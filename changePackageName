To change the android studio package name
	
In Android Studio, you can do this:

For example, if you want to change com.example.app to my.awesome.game, then:

    In your Project pane, click on the little gear icon ( Gears icon )

    Uncheck / De-select the Compact Empty Middle Packages option

Compact Empty Middle Packages

    Your package directory will now be broken up in individual directories

    Individually select each directory you want to rename, and:
        Right-click it
        Select Refactor
        Click on Rename
        In the Pop-up dialog, click on Rename Package instead of Rename Directory
        Enter the new name and hit Refactor
        Click Do Refactor in the bottom
        Allow a minute to let Android Studio update all changes
        Note: When renaming com in Android Studio, it might give a warning. In such case, select Rename All

enter image description here

    Now open your Gradle Build File (build.gradle - Usually app or mobile). Update the applicationId to your new Package Name and Sync Gradle, if it hasn't already been updated automatically:

Refactor Directories

    Done! Anyways, Android Studio needs to make this process a little simpler.

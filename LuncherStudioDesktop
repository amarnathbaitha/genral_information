To create a desktop file do this:

    Open Gedit.

    Paste the following into the file, editing the relevant parts:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Version=1.0
    Type=Application
    Terminal=false
    Icon=someicon
    Exec=sh /path/to/studio.sh
    Name=Android Studio

    Now, save this file as somename.desktop, to your desktop.

    Next, you need to make this file executable by typing the command:

    cd ~/Desktop && chmod a+x somename.desktop

Now, double-clicking the application should launch your application.
